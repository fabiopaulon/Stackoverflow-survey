# Stackoverflow-survey
 
 ### About
 This is an analysis of the Stack Overflow 2020 survey, submitted to Udacity for Data Science Nanodegree's first project.
 
 This project focus on visualizations and data wrangling, used to help understand the market and the perception of employees in technology according to the survey.
 The main idea behind this project is to analyse the interactions between job satisfaction, compensation, job seeking status (if the correspondent is actively looking for jobs or not) and company size.
 Below I present the main questions approached in this work.
 
 
 ### Questions
 
 A: "Do employees of smaller companies earn overall less than those working for bigger companies?"
 B: "Job satisfaction equals bigger salary?"
 C: "What is the influence Job satisfaction and Job seeking factors into Job seeking status?"
